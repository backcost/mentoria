// You will be given a square chess board with one queen and a number 
// of obstacles placed on it. Determine how many squares the queen can 
// attack.

// A queen is standing on an n x n chessboard. The chess board's rows 
// are numbered from 1 to n, going from bottom to top. Its columns are 
// numbered from 1 to n, going from left to right. Each square is 
// referenced by a tuple, (r,c), describing the row, r, and column, c, 
// where the square is located.

// The queen is standing at position (rq, cq). In a single move, she 
// can attack any square in any of the eight directions 
// (left, right, up, down, and the four diagonals). 

// There are obstacles on the chessboard, each preventing the queen 
// from attacking any square beyond it on that path. Given the queen's 
// position and the locations of all the obstacles, find and print the 
// number of squares the queen can attack from her position at (rq, cq).
